            <description>what is esc1? esc1 is a specific vulnerability targeting overly permissive active directory certificate templates that are issued by a CA.
i was honestly pretty surprise how easy this was, and it&amp;rsquo;s something that a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to know about.
after managing to successfully escalate my normal domain account privileges to full domain admin at the company i work for, i decided to spin up a CA and take a further look.</description>

<p>esc1 is a specific vulnerability targeting overly permissive active directory certificate templates that are issued by a CA.</p>
<p>i was honestly pretty surprise how easy this was, and it&rsquo;s something that a lot of people don&rsquo;t seem to know about.</p>
<p>after managing to successfully escalate my normal domain account privileges to full domain admin at the company i work for, i decided to spin up a CA and take a further look.</p>
<h2 id="what-makes-a-template-vulnerable">what makes a template vulnerable?</h2>
<p>there are a few things that we are looking for when exploiting ESC1, however the most damning are enrolment rights being granted to low privileged users and requesters being able to specify a subjectAltName in the CSR.</p>
<p><strong>example 1:</strong>
<img src="/sanRequest.png" alt="subjectAltName"></p>
<p>in the above image the ability to include a subjectAltName in the CSR to that specific template is allowed.</p>
<p>active directory will prioritise the SAN name in a certificate for identity if the field is present. this means that by specifying a specific username in the SAN a .pfx can be requested to impersonate any user (e.g domain administrators)</p>
<p>when creating a new template it does give a warning mentioning the risks upon allowing anybody to request a SAN, however if cloning an existing template with it enabled it does not grant a warning.</p>
