      <description>what is esc1? esc1 is a specific vulnerability targeting overly permissive active directory certificate templates that are issued by a CA.
i was honestly pretty surprise how easy this was, and it&amp;rsquo;s something that a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t seem to know about.
after managing to successfully escalate my normal domain account to a full on domain admin, i decided to spin up a CA and take a further look.</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
