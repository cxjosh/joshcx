      <description>what is adcs? adcs, otherwise known as active directory certificate services is a windows server role that issues and manages PKI certificates that are used in authentication and communication protocols.
these certificates are issued through root and subordinate CA&amp;rsquo;s to various different users, computers and services to maintain certificate validity.
what is esc1? esc1 is a specific vulnerability targeting overly permissive active directory certificate templates that are issued by these CA&amp;rsquo;s.</description>
